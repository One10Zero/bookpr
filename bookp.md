> Youtube (Accounting Stuff= Accounting Basics: Debits and Credits Explained)

- Economic Benefit - The potential for an asset to contribute either directly or inderectly to the flow of an entities cash.

> remember that money does not appear out of nowhere nor disapears out of nowhere. There is always a source and a destination.

- Credits - source 
   - Assets, Expenses, Dividends
      - Assets = Liabilities + Equity
      - Equity = Owners Equity (paid in) - Dividends (paid out) + retained earnings
      > retained earnings think as profit held for future use
      - Retained Earnings = revenue - expenses
      > Lets bring it back to the equation
      - Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity - Dividends + Revenue - Expenses
      > Lets Rearange it 
      - Dividends + Expenses + Assets = Liabitities + Owners Equity + Revenue
      > Debits = Credits
- Debits - destionation
   - Owner Equity, Liabilities, Revenue


## Debits and Credits

The Equation " Assets = Liability + Equity " must always be balanced. Meaning that both side need to be equal to each other. 
- Every time you make a transaction, you record:
  - A debit in one account 
  - A credit in another 
The total Debit must always equal to total credit
> This debunks the notes from youtube video that credits is the source and debits the destination. 

The accounting equation is the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping, so it’s used every single time you record a transaction.
- Every transaction affects at least two accounts.
- The transaction must keep the equation balanced:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

If it doesn’t balance, something’s wrong.

Example:
You take out a $5,000 loan for your business:
- Assets (Cash) go up $5,000
- Liabilities (Loan Payable) go up $5,000
The equation stays balanced.

## Journal Entries

A journal entry is how you record a financial transaction in the accounting system. It always includes:
1. Date of the transaction
2. Accounts affected
3. Debits and Credits
4. Amounts
5. Short description or memo

### Double-Entry Accounting
Every journal entry must balance:
Total Debits = Total Credits
This is based on the Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Example Format of a Journal Entry

Let’s say you buy $500 of office supplies with cash:

| Date | Account | Debit | Credit |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 07/28/2025 | Office Supplies | $500.00 | |
| | Cash | | $500.00| 
| | ***Purchased supplies*** | | |

This entry increases an asset (Office Supplies) and decreases another asset (Cash)
